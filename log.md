# 100 Days Of Code - Log

NOTE: I've started this challege back in December 2016 before getting myself completely familiar with all the rules. Some of my earlier log records are missing essentials like code links. Also, I've shamefully skipped more than 1 day in a row on multiple occasions but I will keep on going no matter what! #lifehappens

### Day 1: December 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Followed tutorial on Node.js basics (Treehouse)

**Technology used**: Node.js

**Thoughts:** My favorite part of Node.js framework so far is that it uses JavaScript, my favorite language of all. Even thought I am just beginning to learn Node.js, it already feels like home to me

### Day 6: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my new freelace project - "Movement Source" website

**Technology used**: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Yay! An actual real worl project! It's been so long since I actually had a real project that is going to be used by a real person who is not mylsef. At least SOMETHING good came out from the family Christmas party :)

### Day 7: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started another freelance projects - "Roxolanna Design Studio" (temp name). Created new Bootstrap installation, chose a template, set up GutHub repository
**Technology used**: Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** It probably wasn't wise to take up 2 projects at the same time, but I am hoping that the pressure will help me stay motivated

### Day 8: January 5, 2016

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Created About Page

**Technology used**: Bootstrpap, HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** One of those tasks that supposed to take 40 mins to complete, but in reality stretches to hours and hours...

### Day 9: January 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Redesigned home page

### Day 10: January 7, 2016

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Worked on the Book.js script - appointment request form

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, jQueryUI - Datepicker

**Thoughts:** Because JavaScript is still a new technology for me, the Book page will probably be the most challengin part of this project for me. The challenge is to display different available time slots for different days of the week. Also, in the future updates I might add the ability to sort time slots by the tyoe of appointment (still waiting for the schedule structure from the client)

### Day 11: January 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Backend Section of The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course; Worked on the appointment booking section of the "Movement Source" website

**Technology used**: Node.js, JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with the Book form. Look into a database option to store the schedule info in. Decided that for the time being it's an overkill, a simple hard-coded schedule should do for the prototype version of the website

### Day 12: January 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code log file. Worked on improving User Interface of the Movement Source home page; fixed links and buttons; added a section on the bottom of the page.

**Technology used**: Markdown, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML

**Thoughts:** Yay! So excited to merge my own 100DayOfCode challnee with the one that CodeNewbie starts today. It was very satisfying to copy all of my old log info into to the GitHub repository. 
Despite the fact that today is our FIVE YEAR wedding anniversary, I am working on the Movement Source website #alwaysBeCoding
Tweaked the appearance of the wesbite - chose 2 Google fonts - Cookie and Raleway (@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cookie|Raleway');
) and replaced the templete fonts. 
My favorite website for free stock images: https://unsplash.com
The home page is finally coming together. I will leave it as is for now and continue working on the rest of the website. My goal is to have prototype ready for review next week. So far I am pretty happy with the design.
