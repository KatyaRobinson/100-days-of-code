# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Days to make up for after 100 days are over: 12/08; 12/10; 

NOTE: I've started this challege back in December 2016 before getting myself completely familiar with all the rules. Some of my earlier log records are missing essentials like code links. Also, I've shamefully skipped more than 1 day in a row on multiple occasions but I will keep on going no matter what! #lifehappens

### Day 1: December 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Followed tutorial on Node.js basics (Treehouse)

**Technology used**: Node.js

**Thoughts:** My favorite part of Node.js framework so far is that it uses JavaScript, my favorite language of all. Even thought I am just beginning to learn Node.js, it already feels like home to me
