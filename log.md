# 100 Days Of Code - Log

NOTE: I've started this challege back in December 2016 before getting myself completely familiar with all the rules. Some of my earlier log records are missing essentials like code links. Also, I've shamefully skipped more than 1 day in a row on multiple occasions but I will keep on going no matter what! #lifehappens


<hr>
### Day 1: December 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Followed tutorial on Node.js basics (Treehouse)

**Technology used**: Node.js

**Thoughts:** My favorite part of Node.js framework so far is that it uses JavaScript, my favorite language of all. Even thought I am just beginning to learn Node.js, it already feels like home to me

<hr>
### Day 3: December 9, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Building a simple dynamic site with Node.js (Treehouse) - cont.

NOTE: And then Christmas in Retail happened and next thing I knew it was New Year

<hr>
### Day 6: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my new freelace project - "Movement Source" website

**Technology used**: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Yay! An actual real worl project! It's been so long since I actually had a real project that is going to be used by a real person who is not mylsef. At least SOMETHING good came out from the family Christmas party :)

<hr>
### Day 7: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started another freelance projects - "Roxolanna Design Studio" (temp name). Created new Bootstrap installation, chose a template, set up GutHub repository
**Technology used**: Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** It probably wasn't wise to take up 2 projects at the same time, but I am hoping that the pressure will help me stay motivated

<hr>
### Day 8: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Created About Page

**Technology used**: Bootstrpap, HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** One of those tasks that supposed to take 40 mins to complete, but in reality stretches to hours and hours...

<hr>
### Day 9: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Redesigned home page

**Technology used**: Bootstrpap, HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** ummmm... I got the commits confused... As this point I wasn't keeping a log yet - see newer commits to this project below

<hr>
### Day 10: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Worked on the Book.js script - appointment request form

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, jQueryUI - Datepicker

**Thoughts:** Because JavaScript is still a new technology for me, the Book page will probably be the most challengin part of this project for me. The challenge is to display different available time slots for different days of the week. Also, in the future updates I might add the ability to sort time slots by the tyoe of appointment (still waiting for the schedule structure from the client)

<hr>
### Day 11: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Backend Section of The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course; Worked on the appointment booking section of the "Movement Source" website

**Technology used**: Node.js, JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with the Book form. Look into a database option to store the schedule info in. Decided that for the time being it's an overkill, a simple hard-coded schedule should do for the prototype version of the website

### Day 12: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code log file. Worked on improving User Interface of the Movement Source home page; fixed links and buttons; added a section on the bottom of the page.

**Technology used**: Markdown, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML

**Thoughts:** Yay! So excited to merge my own 100DayOfCode challnee with the one that CodeNewbie starts today. It was very satisfying to copy all of my old log info into to the GitHub repository. 
Despite the fact that today is our FIVE YEAR wedding anniversary, I am working on the Movement Source website #alwaysBeCoding
Tweaked the appearance of the wesbite - chose 2 Google fonts - Cookie and Raleway (@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cookie|Raleway');
) and replaced the templete fonts. 
My favorite website for free stock images: https://unsplash.com
The home page is finally coming together. I will leave it as is for now and continue working on the rest of the website. My goal is to have prototype ready for review next week. So far I am pretty happy with the design.

<hr>

### Day 14: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Refined CSS for the page

**Technology used**: HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** I feel so foolish for refusing to use Bootstrap for my projects in the past... Such a time saver.

### Day 15: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website - trying to make AJAX loading of calendar happen... #struggleisreal

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX

**Thoughts:** I can tell my JavaScript skills are still pretty weak :( Struggling like crazy with the simpliest script, have to google almost every single line. Not giving up though!..

<hr>
### Day 16: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Cleaned the code by moving JS to a sepate file. Moved calendar to the bottom of the "Services" page. Made nav stick to the top of the page on scroll, added a logo to the nav-fixed-top.

**To Do Next** Sidebar nav for the Services page to simply navigate between the different services offered

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Pleased with the results of my coding hour today. Refactoring this code will suck... So far my goal is just to make it work, I will worry about pretty code later

<hr>
### Day 17: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Cleaned my messy code. Added simple-sidebar to the page for easier navigation of the services. Because I used an open-sources sidebar, it is not tailored to my website yet, I'll have to work on making in fit in with the design

**To Do Next** Resize main content container to accomodate for the sidebar. Ideally, the size needs to match other pages' containers. On small screens sidebar needs to dissapear into hamburger or completely. Add smooth scrolling to elements when sidebar button is presses.
Remove logo on mobile menu

**Technology used**: jQuery

**Thoughts:** I see divs everywhere...
Changing my coding schedule to mornings has improved my productivity tremendously! I can't believe I've never tried it before. When I come home from work at night, coding is the last thing I want to do. But in the morning I feel motivated and full of energy. Love my coffee and coding PJ parties!

<hr>
### Day 18: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Added smooth scrolling to elements when a sidebar button is presses. Resize main content container (#wrapper) to accomodate for the width of the sidebar. Added "Bring me to top" button. Styles the sidebar menu to fit the overall design better.

**To Do Next**  On small screens sidebar needs to dissapear into hamburger or completely. Remove logo on mobile menu. Style sidebar some more. Work on the calandar. Organize JS code better.

**Technology used**: jQuery

**Thoughts:** There must be a way to organize HTML better... Back in college I've used PHP to load chunks of HTML into a oage, so all the reusable elements only needed to be coded once. I tried creating sepdrate html files for header and footer and load them with AJAX but that made for an awkward page loading experience when a page would load withouht a header at all and then it would appear and render the page as an afterthought... I know I will find a solution to this problem eventually, for now will just have to deal with messy code... #sadness.
I can't wait to look at this code a few month from now and cringe... It's crazy how fast you can learn in short time when you have all the resources.

<hr>
### Day 19: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Services page: styles sidebar. Added .active class to the sidebar menu elements on click and scroll. Added the new header and footer to the rest of tha pages. Made sidebar collapse on small screens. Added Facebook feed. Created and started styling Contact page

**To Do Next**  Make services menu open on button click - Have to leave this for next time. Remove logo on mobile menu. Style sidebar some more. Work on the calandar. Move Facebook feed to Contact page. On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. 

**Technology used**: jQuery

**Thoughts:** The code is getting more and more inrticate and I don't even use any fancy technologies... Or maybe it is messy BECAUSE I don't use any fancy technologies?.. Hmmm... :/
The secondary Service menu is driving me insane... It doesn't work as smoothly as the Bootstrap built-in collapsible menu. Thank god for GutHub and ability to roll back to a previous commit. I broke my own code like 5 times today trying to get the stupid menu to work. I'm sure it's something obviuos, I'm just tired. For today I will leave it alone and work on something else.
I'm collecting ideas for my Portfolio.2.0. Thinking about making it one-page with additional pages for people who want to get more info. My portfolio will have a blog-style sidebar meny. I plan of making it feel as a more of a personal blog site rather than resume-style professional showcase.

### Day 19.2

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do any actual coding, so I won't count this day in the progress. Work was very slow so I had a lot of time to brainstorm my portfolio.2.0 website. Came up with a couple of nice ideas. Drew up first paper mockup, wrote out the main concept, sections, topics to discuss, areas to cover. "Comissioned" my husband to draw a logo. Next steps would be creating a digital mockup and then - to coding!


<hr>
### Day 20: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited footer. Watched Trump talk. Worked on "Secure my spot" button. Now the SelectedService is changed appropriate to the section from where a button was pressed.

Move Facebook feed to Contact page. On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. Choose an icon pack and implement with the design. Add social media icons to the footer and header. Fix front page slider click event. Idea: Create a BLOG/NEWS page for future updates and facebook FEED?

**Technology used**: 

**Thoughts:**  I don't know if I can code today. Right now I have US Presidential Inaguration LIVE playing in Twitter in the background... I'll try my best to be productive.

<hr>
### Day 21: January 21, 2017

On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. Choose an icon pack and implement with the design. Add social media icons to the footer and header.

<hr>
### Day 22: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on the scheduling functionality. Spent ALLLLLLLLL day off working on JavaScript - custom calendar fnctionality.It is finally working. I know my code is ugly, but currently I am more concerned about functionality. Created a json file with the class schedule from scratch. Now once a date is clicked, the available time slots get displayd. Each timeslot is a button of its own, when one of those clocked a messaged pops up giving info of what date and time was selected and then the user is prompted to fill up their personal informtion to wrap up the request and them eventually send it in an email. 

**To Do Next**  Make services menu open on button click - Have to leave this for next time. Remove logo on mobile menu. Remoce Facebook comletely unless Blog page is eventually created. On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. Choose an icon pack and implement with the design. Add social media icons to the footer and header.

Also - style timeSlots responsible for specific classes and add an anchor link to the class description. Oh my god, I'm so tired... All day...

**Technology used**: JavaScript/jQuery

**Thoughts:** Day 22... I need to finish the Movement Source website, I feel like I'm taking too long working on it for what it is. Everything is ready besides the appointment scheduling functionality. I need to finish that ASAP, do final desing tweaks and present it to the client. Then I'll work on whatever changes she requires, if there are any. But at least I will have a finished project to showcase on my portfolio website. Then I will work on building my new portfolio. 

Future functionality: save all the requests in a database

### Day 23: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded existing files into a separate folder on my personal (ugly) website, so I can test mobile screen functionality.

**Technology used**: JavaScript/jQuery, CSS

**Thoughts:** I need to restart my Photoshop subscription. You can tell the images I'm using are not custom made, Instead of creating my won content, I am using what I can find and then adapt to it. That's not good. Tomorrow is my day off, I'll have a lot of time to work on this project and I will re-create all elements using Photoshop. I can't believe I've been working with no mockup at all this whole time...All I had for this project was some notepad doodles.

**Thoughts:**  As usual, the closer to the end of the project I get, the less motivation there is. All the easy stuff has been done and everyhting that remains is the tasks that I've been putting off either because they are boring or because I don't quite know how to complete them... But I have to power through that. I'm so close to finishing.

I will either get to it after submitting the first version of Movement Source website to the client and waiting for feedback or maybe I'll work on some in between my main work sessions...

**Technology used**: jQuery, PHP

**Thoughts:** It feels good when things are finally working like intended :) ANother proof that somwtimes what it takes is just walking away from the editor and revisiting the project a little later. The curse, or, rather - blessing of a fresh eye!

**Technology used**: jQuery, AJAX, CSS, PHP.

**Thoughts:** Took me embarassingly long time to get such small projects done. Тяжело в учении, легко в бою. 
Programming Gods have been kind to me today - php email() all of a sudden started working! I just checked my enmail and saw 47 email from my form submission tests. I have no idea why it works now and it is scary.
I feel so stupid. That one day I battled with PHP login script and got nothing done was because I was looking for a PASSCODE instead of PASSWORD. So dumb.

### Day 38: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No progress. Just frustrated, wrecked brain... Sad day.

**Technology used**: PHP, not very successfully though...

**Thoughts:** Kind of took a week off because of the Valentine's day. No, not because I was celebrated, but because everyone waits till the very last day to buy gitfts to their loved ones, so work was incredibly busy. Well and then my husband and I took a little 2 day trip to Delaware to visit family and friends. I worked hard, I feel like I deserve it. But now I am happy to be back in my routine. 
I will have 3 full days off next week. My plan is to drive somewhere where I can work uninterupted and where I can't can distracted by my own house chores and work on the backened of the MS project, specifically - figuring out a way to open and hopefully interact with specific masages pulled from dataabase.... 
Spent en entire hour trying to sort the appointment requests by date and did't come up with anything working. PHP is not my thing... I feel so dumb...

**Link to work:** Nada

### Day 39: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with PHP session to keep site admin logged while browsing the wesbite. When user is logged in, the main menu extends to include 2 more options: Appointments and Mail.

Used CSS Tricks article to make the table responsive. - Styled appointment requests in a better way. Sort by dates and class types. - Added ability to click on every request, review it and reply directly to the customer - USED PHP DYNAMIC LINKS

**Technology used**: PHP

**Thoughts:** Feel soooo good about my progress today! Now the MS website isn't just pretty but also highly functional :) I used PHP so much which is kind of cool because I really didn't think I had it in me. So happy!!

### Day 40: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: - Added session to every page, so when admin is logged in, she stays logged in. Changes all .html links and files to .php links and files. Broke and then fixed the appointment request button. When I was changing the header part of every page to include new .php links I forgot that my Services page had an additional set of script links on it. Now all is fixed, thanks to GitHub! I went backand looked at what the source code looked like until I broke it. Awesome!
Fixed GoogleMaps on Contact Page - it is now shows correct location with a nice zoom.
Created Temporary page to replace my stupid portfolio website.

Learning about Pug.js.

**Technology used**: PHP, GoogleMaps API, JS, Pug.js

**Thoughts:** I'm kind of on a roll! A spider bit me in the eyelid last night so i called off work today, which gives me 3 days off in a row! Whoa! I will barely work this week. I will definitely put in time this week to get a step closet to building a portfolio that will get me a job.
Yesterday I watched a movie on Ntflix called "Code. Bebugging the gender gap" about role of women in tech worls. That movie inspired me even more to become a good engeneer and respresent my gender. 
I'm about to apply for a job I found on craigslist and decided that I absolutely cannot apply with a resume that has my portfolio websit on it while it's in this embarassing state... So idecided to create a "tempararily not in service" page that will feature some fun animation on it... I think it'll be nice. And I'll take my picture off of it, people can still see what I look like on all of my social media profiles. Annndd - to work!

### Day 42: February 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watched lectures on UX design. 

**Technology used**: Laptop, notebook, pen and BRAIN!

**Thoughts:**   Decided to give my brain a break and learn something different for a change of scenery. I don't know a lot about UX design and I've been wanting to research some main principles of it for a long time. Today I just happened to stumble upon an article on UX online cources, one of which looked very interesting. I found it on springboard.com (https://www.springboard.com/learning-paths/user-experience-design/). Additionaly, I ordered the "Envisioning Information" book online (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0961392118/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Can't wait to read it!
Also, I signed up for DailySVGImages challenge. I don't know if I will actually do it... I do need to get better at creating my own images... 
 
**Link to work:** No links to work today, no actual coding was done, just tons of notes taken!

<hr>
### Day 43: February 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the View.php and welcome.php pages of the MS website. Fixed the "Confirm" button to actually change the status of record. Made all dates in the past fade. 
Started commenting the code before I forgot everythign I did there. 
Restyled buttons on the View.php page (Confirm, Delete, Contact client) so they don't look so ugly.
Restyled the View.php page completely. Added status to the appointment record and made it change the value according to the sctual status of the request.

**Technology used**: PHP, jQuery

**Thoughts:** As soon as I am done with the managing appointments functionality I will just go around and fix small inperfections. Then I will have Harry test the site. Then I will show it to the client. Can't wait to have it live and move on to something else! Yay!
I decided to stop adding new features until I get feedback from client.

### Day 44: February 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Mail.php page, made some minor improvements to the appointments table - it is now automatically gets sorted by the date and entire past date row is faded. 

**Technology used**: PHP

**Thoughts:** I don't know how it happened but I added another page to the website - Mail.php. This page will display messages sent from the Contact page. This is going to be a backup option in case php(mail) doesn't happen to work again... I know I promised not adding more functionality but I just can't help it!

### Day 45: February 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Added social media, contact icons. Styled header ans footer to better fit overall design.

**Technology used**: 

**Thoughts:** The website header bugs me so much. That clunky "Contact" button is staring into my soul and screaming: "Amateur!" Decided to get rid of it altogether and replace with some cute elegant icons.

### Day 46: February 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Research, reserach, research.

**Technology used**: BRAIN!

**Thoughts:** Today I am a research maniac. I keep gathering bits and pieces of ideas for my portfolio/blog. What would be REALLY cool is to build it using new technology like the MEAN stack. When I look at the code of the MEAN projects it's just so clean and elegant. I want to know how to do that! I want my code to be beautiful from inside and outside alike.

### Day 47: February 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Read a few chapters of the "Envisioning Information" book on UX Design.

### Day 49: March 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Added type of class to the appointment request. Now it is displayed on page before submitting request and on the admin individual appointment screen. Tweaked design as always. Went back to the MEAN course I bought on Udemy website, currently learning to use Express framework. Hoping to build my next project with MEAN stack. 

**Technology used**: lil bit of everything

**Thoughts:** Decided it's time to wrap up the MS website. Melted my brain by trying to find a way to edit JSON file from front end. Found a couple of tool, all seem too complicated for my needs... I guess I'll have the client look at the site and go from there...

### Day 53: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the following sections of the WebDevBootcamp course on udemy:
- Intro to Mongoose - Parts 1 and 2 (watched tutorials, didn't follow along yet)

**Technology used**: 

**Thoughts:** Still waiting for the client feedback on th MS website. Not gonna lie, it is a relief to leave it finally. I leanred a lot doing that project and I'm not even talking about Bootstrap and jQuery. I learned to plan out a projects complately before starting. Also, talk to the client and determine their needs before even doing the first sketch. And, put more thought into what framework to use. In retrospect, I should've probably used Wordpress to give the client more freedom in terms of changing content... You live and you learn. 

Today I'll continue working on my MEAN course, which actually turned out to be just a MEN course... So no Angualr. Which is kind of dissapointing...
Got feedback from the MS client, she liked what I've done, but needs to make changes. We need to schedule a meeting to discuss.

### Day 55: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Learned about Restful routing

**Technology used**: 

**Thoughts:** Happy International Women's Day to me and all women (especially in tech). Today I looked up some web developers' portfolios for inspirations and found a couple that I really liked. They were all very different but had one thing in common - each one was:
1. unique, which made it stand out
2. full of "extra" content, which made it feel personable...
That gave me some ideas about my own portfolio. I don't want it to be just an ad for my services. I want it to be a place for me to tell my story. Maybe I'm wring... But this is how I see it and I will stand by it.
I decided I'll use Node. So this online course I'm taking will really help.

**Link to work:** No links to submit today...>
