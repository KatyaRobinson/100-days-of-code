# 100 Days Of Code - Log

NOTE: I've started this challege back in December 2016 before getting myself completely familiar with all the rules. Some of my earlier log records are missing essentials like code links. Also, I've shamefully skipped more than 1 day in a row on multiple occasions but I will keep on going no matter what! #lifehappens

### Day 1: December 6, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Followed tutorial on Node.js basics (Treehouse)

**Technology used**: Node.js

**Thoughts:** My favorite part of Node.js framework so far is that it uses JavaScript, my favorite language of all. Even thought I am just beginning to learn Node.js, it already feels like home to me

NOTE: And then Christmas in Retail happened and next thing I knew it was New Year

<hr>
### Day 6: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my new freelace project - "Movement Source" website

**Technology used**: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Yay! An actual real worl project! It's been so long since I actually had a real project that is going to be used by a real person who is not mylsef. At least SOMETHING good came out from the family Christmas party :)

<hr>
### Day 7: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started another freelance projects - "Roxolanna Design Studio" (temp name). Created new Bootstrap installation, chose a template, set up GutHub repository
**Technology used**: Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** It probably wasn't wise to take up 2 projects at the same time, but I am hoping that the pressure will help me stay motivated

### Day 8: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Created About Page

**Technology used**: Bootstrpap, HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** One of those tasks that supposed to take 40 mins to complete, but in reality stretches to hours and hours...

<hr>
### Day 9: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Redesigned home page

**Technology used**: Bootstrpap, HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** ummmm... I got the commits confused... As this point I wasn't keeping a log yet - see newer commits to this project below

<hr>
### Day 10: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Movement Source" website - Worked on the Book.js script - appointment request form

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, jQueryUI - Datepicker

**Thoughts:** Because JavaScript is still a new technology for me, the Book page will probably be the most challengin part of this project for me. The challenge is to display different available time slots for different days of the week. Also, in the future updates I might add the ability to sort time slots by the tyoe of appointment (still waiting for the schedule structure from the client)

<hr>
### Day 11: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Backend Section of The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course; Worked on the appointment booking section of the "Movement Source" website

**Technology used**: Node.js, JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with the Book form. Look into a database option to store the schedule info in. Decided that for the time being it's an overkill, a simple hard-coded schedule should do for the prototype version of the website

### Day 12: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code log file. Worked on improving User Interface of the Movement Source home page; fixed links and buttons; added a section on the bottom of the page.

**Technology used**: Markdown, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML

**Thoughts:** Yay! So excited to merge my own 100DayOfCode challnee with the one that CodeNewbie starts today. It was very satisfying to copy all of my old log info into to the GitHub repository. 
Despite the fact that today is our FIVE YEAR wedding anniversary, I am working on the Movement Source website #alwaysBeCoding
Tweaked the appearance of the wesbite - chose 2 Google fonts - Cookie and Raleway (@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cookie|Raleway');
) and replaced the templete fonts. 
My favorite website for free stock images: https://unsplash.com
The home page is finally coming together. I will leave it as is for now and continue working on the rest of the website. My goal is to have prototype ready for review next week. So far I am pretty happy with the design.

### Day 14: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Refined CSS for the page

**Technology used**: HTML, CSS

**Thoughts:** I feel so foolish for refusing to use Bootstrap for my projects in the past... Such a time saver.

### Day 15: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website - trying to make AJAX loading of calendar happen... #struggleisreal

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX

**Thoughts:** I can tell my JavaScript skills are still pretty weak :( Struggling like crazy with the simpliest script, have to google almost every single line. Not giving up though!..

### Day 16: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Cleaned the code by moving JS to a sepate file. Moved calendar to the bottom of the "Services" page. Made nav stick to the top of the page on scroll, added a logo to the nav-fixed-top.

**To Do Next** Sidebar nav for the Services page to simply navigate between the different services offered

**Technology used**: JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Pleased with the results of my coding hour today. Refactoring this code will suck... So far my goal is just to make it work, I will worry about pretty code later

<hr>
### Day 17: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Cleaned my messy code. Added simple-sidebar to the page for easier navigation of the services. Because I used an open-sources sidebar, it is not tailored to my website yet, I'll have to work on making in fit in with the design

**To Do Next** Resize main content container to accomodate for the sidebar. Ideally, the size needs to match other pages' containers. On small screens sidebar needs to dissapear into hamburger or completely. Add smooth scrolling to elements when sidebar button is presses.
Remove logo on mobile menu

**Technology used**: jQuery

**Thoughts:** I see divs everywhere...
Changing my coding schedule to mornings has improved my productivity tremendously! I can't believe I've never tried it before. When I come home from work at night, coding is the last thing I want to do. But in the morning I feel motivated and full of energy. Love my coffee and coding PJ parties!

<hr>
### Day 18: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the "Services" page of the Movement Source Website. Added smooth scrolling to elements when a sidebar button is presses. Resize main content container (#wrapper) to accomodate for the width of the sidebar. Added "Bring me to top" button. Styles the sidebar menu to fit the overall design better.

**To Do Next**  On small screens sidebar needs to dissapear into hamburger or completely. Remove logo on mobile menu. Style sidebar some more. Work on the calandar. Organize JS code better.

**Technology used**: jQuery

**Thoughts:** There must be a way to organize HTML better... Back in college I've used PHP to load chunks of HTML into a oage, so all the reusable elements only needed to be coded once. I tried creating sepdrate html files for header and footer and load them with AJAX but that made for an awkward page loading experience when a page would load withouht a header at all and then it would appear and render the page as an afterthought... I know I will find a solution to this problem eventually, for now will just have to deal with messy code... #sadness.
I can't wait to look at this code a few month from now and cringe... It's crazy how fast you can learn in short time when you have all the resources.

<hr>
### Day 19: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Services page: styles sidebar. Added .active class to the sidebar menu elements on click and scroll. Added the new header and footer to the rest of tha pages. Made sidebar collapse on small screens. Added Facebook feed. Created and started styling Contact page

**To Do Next**  Make services menu open on button click - Have to leave this for next time. Remove logo on mobile menu. Style sidebar some more. Work on the calandar. Move Facebook feed to Contact page. On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. 

**Technology used**: jQuery

**Thoughts:** The code is getting more and more inrticate and I don't even use any fancy technologies... Or maybe it is messy BECAUSE I don't use any fancy technologies?.. Hmmm... :/
The secondary Service menu is driving me insane... It doesn't work as smoothly as the Bootstrap built-in collapsible menu. Thank god for GutHub and ability to roll back to a previous commit. I broke my own code like 5 times today trying to get the stupid menu to work. I'm sure it's something obviuos, I'm just tired. For today I will leave it alone and work on something else.
I'm collecting ideas for my Portfolio.2.0. Thinking about making it one-page with additional pages for people who want to get more info. My portfolio will have a blog-style sidebar meny. I plan of making it feel as a more of a personal blog site rather than resume-style professional showcase.

### Day 19.2

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do any actual coding, so I won't count this day in the progress. Work was very slow so I had a lot of time to brainstorm my portfolio.2.0 website. Came up with a couple of nice ideas. Drew up first paper mockup, wrote out the main concept, sections, topics to discuss, areas to cover. "Comissioned" my husband to draw a logo. Next steps would be creating a digital mockup and then - to coding!

### Day 20: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited footer. Watched Trump talk. Worked on "Secure my spot" button. Now the SelectedService is changed appropriate to the section from where a button was pressed. 

**To Do Next**  Make services menu open on button click - Have to leave this for next time. Remove logo on mobile menu. Style sidebar some more. Work on the calandar. Move Facebook feed to Contact page. On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. Choose an icon pack and implement with the design. Add social media icons to the footer and header. Fix front page slider click event. Idea: Create a BLOG/NEWS page for future updates and facebook FEED?

**Technology used**: 

**Thoughts:**  I don't know if I can code today. Right now I have US Presidential Inaguration LIVE playing in Twitter in the background... I'll try my best to be productive.

### Day 21: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the calendar functionality. Not much progress, JavaScript is my weakness :( Going to have to read some more before attempting this bit... Fixed front slider click event.

**To Do Next**  Make services menu open on button click - Have to leave this for next time. Remove logo on mobile menu.  Move Facebook feed to Contact page. On mobile screen adjust size of logo and menu toggle button to make them fit on one row together. Choose an icon pack and implement with the design. Add social media icons to the footer and header.

**Technology used**: 

**Thoughts:** I need to re-read some of the JavaScript books I have. The first time I read them was when I didn't have any practical experience. I feel like now, that I have some context, everything will make a lot more sense to me.
